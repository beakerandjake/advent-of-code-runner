# advent-of-code-runner

A Node.Js CLI solution generator and runner for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Features
- Quickly and easily scaffolds an empty directory, creating all required solution files (similar to create-react-app). 
- Runs your solutions (both sync and async) and measures performance. 
- Downloads and caches puzzle input files.
- Submits answers to advent of code.
- Tracks submitted answers and prevents duplicate submissions.
- Stores and outputs statistics to the CLI or your README file.
- Rate limits submissions to prevent timeout penalties.
- Tracks your progress and knows which puzzle to run. 

## Installation
In an empty directory or a freshly created github repository run the following command
```
npx advent-of-code-runner init 
```
You will be asked a few questions, and then your project files will be generated and the dependencies will be installed.

## Please note this is a WIP repo and is not ready to be used
